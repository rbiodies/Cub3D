# Cub3D
The goal of this project is to create a “realistic” 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze from a first-person perspective using the Ray-Casting principles.
## Ray-Casting
Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. Back when computers were slower it wasn't possible to run real 3D engines in realtime, and raycasting was the first solution. Raycasting can go very fast, because only a calculation has to be done for every vertical line of the screen. The most well known game that used this technique, is of course Wolfenstein 3D.
## Wolfenstein 3D
This project is inspired by the world-famous [Wolfenstein 3D](http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/) game, which
was the first FPS ever.

## MiniLibX
MiniLibX is a tiny graphics library which allows you to do the most basic things for rendering something in screens without any knowledge of X-Window and Cocoa. It provides so-called simple window creation, a questionable drawing tool, half-ass image functions and a weird event management system.
